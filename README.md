# PyTorch Implementation

This repository contains PyTorch implementations for various neural network models, including:

- **Linear Classification** (Binary & Multi-class Classification)
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**

## 📌 Features

- Implementations using **PyTorch**
- Support for **binary and multi-class classification**
- CNN architecture for more complex tasks
- Easy-to-follow structure for training and evaluation



## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Python 3.7+** installed along with the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib
```


## 📊 Results

The models provide performance metrics such as accuracy and loss, which are logged during training.

## 🛠 Future Improvements

- Add support for **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**
- Implement **Hyperparameter tuning**
- Improve dataset augmentation techniques
